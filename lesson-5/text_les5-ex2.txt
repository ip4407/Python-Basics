readline()
Read and return a single logical line from the current file (or from an internal buffer if lines have previously been
“unread” with unreadline()).
If the join_lines option is true, this may involve reading multiple physical lines concatenated into a single string.

Updates the current line number, so calling warn() after readline()
emits a warning about the physical line(s) just read.

Returns None on end-of-file, since the empty string can occur if rstrip_ws is true but strip_blanks is not.
